Shellpool
=========

Shellpool is a way to run external programs from within a Common Lisp
program.  It features:

 - **Forking control**.  Sub-programs are launched with a separate shell, so
   you can avoid
   [forking](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fork_%28operating_system%29) your
   Lisp image, which may be unreliable when applications have dozens of GB of
   memory allocated or involve multiple threads.

 - **Output handling**.  You can easily stream, filter, or collect output from
   the command.  You can access both stdout and stderr lines as they are
   produced, and can tell the difference between them.

 - **Exit code**.  You get it.

 - **Interruption**.  Interrupts are handled gracefully.  After you interrupt
   (e.g., Control C), you can `:continue` to keep running the program, or `:q`
   to terminate the program and return to Lisp as normal.

 - **Multithreading**.  You can safely launch multiple programs from multiple
   threads.  Threading support is based on the
   [bordeaux-threads](http://common-lisp.net/project/bordeaux-threads/)
   library.

 - **Portability**.  It runs on [many Lisps and operating systems](PLATFORMS.md).

Note: Shellpool is **not** suitable for running sub-commands that need access
to command-line input from the user or for
[TTY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminal_emulator)-based programs.

## Related Lisp Libraries

If shellpool isn't quite right for you, here are some related Lisp libraries.

 - [inferior-shell](http://common-lisp.net/projects/qitab/) is allegedly very
   complete and portable for synchronous shells.  It has fancy features like
   support for remote execution (via ssh) and a domain specific language for
   constructing pipelines of shell commands.

 - [trivial-shell](http://common-lisp.net/project/trivial-shell/) is less full
   featured than `inferior-shell,` but is apparently highly portable.

 - [ASDF](http://common-lisp.net/project/asdf/asdf.html) has `run-program`
   shell-command with many options.

 - [external-program](https://github.com/sellout/external-program) is a wrapper
   for `run-program` functionality.
